[h2]Config:[/h2]
[b]PDA/Cell Phone/Shellphone Integration[/b] - By default, the Scrying Mirror, C.R.M. Counter, and Threat Analyzer have been added to the PDA's recipe, and provide their displays to it, the Cell Phone, and Shellphone. However, this feature can be toggled, for those who don't want to have to gather even more info accessories for their cellular device. 
Also has some cross-mod support, including; 
[list]
    [*]Thorium's Wishing Glass
    [*]Avalon's Shadow Phone
    [*]The Depth's respective Shellphone variant
    [*]Fargo's World Shaper Soul (and upgrades)
    [*]Maddie's Completeness Mod's Cell Phone+ (and upgrades)
[/list]

[b]Easier Attainment[/b] - Don't want to jump through more hoops for more info? With this toggle you can make it so that the Merchant will sell all the new accessories (Excluding the tinkers) based on moon phase, making your life that much easier.
