When a task is completed:
- Build/reload in tModLoader Mod Sources and verify no load-time errors in Logs.
- Smoke test in-game: item names (prefix/suffix), tooltip translation, chat/menu translations, whip/minion behavior.
- Review logs for DeepL errors/timeouts; validate cache hits.
- Commit with clear message and reference to features or fixes; push.
- If public release, update build.txt version and description, and publish via Workshop.
