- Fixed Keybinds localization key shape (nested object with quoted display name)
- Unified selection math and debug overlays in AiPhoneRadialUI
- Added VS Code tasks: Build, tModLoader build, HJSON Audit, Build+Audit
- Added scripts/check-hjson.ps1 (detects dot-display misuse and placeholder parity sample)
- Verified HJSON via loc-ref auditFile; no issues
- Reminder: Close tModLoader to avoid TML003 when building
